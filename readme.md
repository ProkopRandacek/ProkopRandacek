i believe that free software should not be hosted on a platform that seems to be the opposite of free software

i don't like:
* [github founder attacking free software licenses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bAAlPXB2-c)
* copilot ads
* github CI scripts are very verbose compared to sr.ht's
* forking and clonning on every patch is lengthy process compared to just `git send-email`
* for-profit, proprietary
* using free software code without asking to develop for-profit proprietary products is rude

see software freedom conservancy's [give up github](https://giveupgithub.org)

i live happily at [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/) as [~prokop](https://sr.ht/~prokop/)
